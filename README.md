# Employee-java
Imagine you have two classes: Employee (which represents being an employee) and Ninja (which represents being a Ninja). An Employee has both state and behaviour; a Ninja has only behaviour. You need to represent an employee who is also a ninja (a common problem in the real world). By creating only one interface and only one class (NinjaEmployee), show how you can do this without having to copy method implementation code from either of the original classes.
